     Webservice:  A Web Service is a software system designed to support machine-to-machine interaction over a network.

     API:  An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions and procedures allows to communicate applications with each other.
     A web API is a subset of web services that use REST conventions.
     
    Web is switching towards Web API/REST. Very complicated to develop and they eat much more resources (bandwidtch and RAM)
    
    Summary:
      1. All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not Web services.
      2. Web services might not perform all the operations that an API would perform.
      3. A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for
      communication whereas API may use any style for communication.
      4. A Web service always needs a network for its operation whereas an API doesnâ€™t need
      a network for its operation.

# Types:
   1. SOAP WEB SERVICE: SOAP is based on transferring XML data. SOAP is a protocol
   2. REST WEB SERVICE: Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service.
                       Rest is a architecture/design.
