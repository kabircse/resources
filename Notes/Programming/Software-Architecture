# Software Atchitecture:
## Defination: Software architecture of a system describes its major components, their relationships and how they interact with each other.
## Uses: Software architecture is used to define the skeleton and the high level components of a system and how they interact with each other.
## Choosing an architecture will determine how you deal with performance, fault tolerance, scalability, and reliability.

# Software Desgin: 
## Defination:
## Uses: Software design is useed for code level design, what each module is doing, the class scope and the function, purposes etc.

## When to pick a SQL database : If you are writing a stock trading, banking or a finance-based app, or you need to store a lot of relationships, for instance and needs transactions and data consistenc(ACID)
Relational databases are built to store relationships
##  When to pick a NoSQL database : When you need to scale fast because there are a large number of read-write operations in a system and when dealing with a large amount of data.
NoSQL databases fit best in these scenarios. Since they have the ability to add nodes on the fly, they can handle more concurrent traffic and large amounts of data with minimal latency.
