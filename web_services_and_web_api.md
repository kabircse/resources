API:
An application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, data structures, object classes and/or protocols provided by libraries and/or operating system services in order to support the building of applications.

Webservice:
A Web Service is defined by the W3C as "a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network"

 Web services and web api:
      A web service allows for machine to machine communications over HTTP. 
      A web API is a subset of web services that use REST conventions.
  Web is switching towards Web API / REST. Web Services are really no better than Web API. 
  Very complicated to develop and they eat much more resources (bandwidtch and RAM)

  Summary:
    1. All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not Web services.
    2. Web services might not perform all the operations that an API would perform.
    3. A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for
    communication whereas API may use any style for communication.
    4. A Web service always needs a network for its operation whereas an API doesnâ€™t need
    a network for its operation.
